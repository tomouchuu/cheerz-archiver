## Tampermonkey Script to download Photos+Voice from Cheerz

### Install // Setup

You'll first want Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey for your relevant browser then to install this script head to: https://github.com/tomouchuu/cheerz-archiver/raw/master/index.user.js and tampermonkey should prompt you to install the script.

You'll also need to head to your settings for these and make sure you can actually download. For me with Tampermonkey, I needed to set the settings to Advanced then find the area that says **Downloads BETA**, update the Download Mode to Native and also add a new line to the whitelisted extensions for `.m4a`.

### Usage

Navigate to an artist page on Cheerz itself (Here is a good one: https://cheerz.cz/artist/4940) and if the script is active you should see an Archive Posts button in the top right corner. Click that and it should start the archive process automatically for you by opening each item and saving the photo + voice.

Once this starts, leave your browser alone for a bit and you should come back to a downloads folder filled with good images and voice!
